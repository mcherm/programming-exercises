<h1>Episode 4 Directions</h1>
    <p>
        My third version works up until it hits a recursion limit. BUT, it takes an ever-increasing amount of memory,
        both because of the stack frames and because of the ever-growing memo dictionary. It is a common limitation of
        recursive techniques. Can you convert to a format that takes a fixed amount of memory (except for growing
        as the size of the numbers grows) for any number of iterations? If, like mine, you used a recursive
        approach this will require using support for tail-call elimination or transforming it to an iterative approach.
    </p>
    <p>
        This step illustrates an important, but more specialized optimization: <b>Converting to iterative approaches.</b>
        Of course, it also illustrates the very general point that <b>optimizing memory usage (or disk accesses or
        some other resource) can matter as much or more than optimizing for execution steps</b>.
