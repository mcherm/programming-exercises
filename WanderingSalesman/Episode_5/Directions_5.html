    <h1>Episode 5 Directions</h1>
    <p>
        The 4th version is pretty darn good. My implementations can find answers up to 20,000 - 30,000
        within less than half a minute. But if you look at "expected-count.json", you'll see results for
        much larger values. Doing better than this solution -- not just slight shavings of time but a
        true performance difference that has improved Big-O behavior -- is quite a challenge. Can you
        find a solution?

        This final step illustrates that sometimes improvements need more than common optimization
        techniques -- they require mathematical analysis.
