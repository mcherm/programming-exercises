        My first version only worked for sizes up to about 13 without waiting unreasonably long. Did yours cap out at
        about that size? In my case, the problem was that I actually generated all the paths. But the problem doesn't
        ask to SEE the paths, it asks to COUNT the paths. If you generated all the paths, see if you can make it more
        efficient by just counting them without generating the paths.

        There is a general principle of optimization illustrated here: <b>Avoid doing extra work that isn't needed.</b>
