Limits:

Build List Limit: (#1)
    Java: soft limit around 14.
    JavaScript: soft limit around 14.
    Python: soft limit around 13.
    Go: soft limit around 11.
    Rust: soft limit around 14.

Count w/o caching: (#2)
    Java: soft limit around 18.
    JavaScript: soft limit around 18.
    Python: soft limit around 15.
    Go: soft limit around 17.
    Rust: soft limit around 16.

Bigint Limit: (#3)
    Java: bigint limit after 36 if using long; after 21 if using int.
    JavaScript: bigint limit after 31. (And at 32 the error is subtle... it's rounded off.)
    Python: no limit.
    Go: bigint limit after 36.
    Rust: bigint limit after 19 if using u32; after 37 if using u64; after 73 if using u128.

Recursion Limit: (#3)
    Java: recursion limit after 6510.
    JavaScript: recursion limit after 5012.
    Python: recursion limit after 333.
    Go: recursion limit exists, but it's larger than 100000 which is a soft limit for time.
    Rust: recursion limit after 6088.

Reasonable Execution time (#4):
    Java: soft limit around 200000.
    JavaScript: soft limit around 300000.
    Python: soft limit around 200000.
    Go: soft limit around 300000.
    Rust: soft limit around 300000.

Reasonable Execution time (#5):
    Java: soft limit around 800000 (~30 seconds)
    JavaScript: soft limit around 2500000 (~30 seconds) [turns out it's already multi-threaded]
    Python: soft limit around 500000 (~30 seconds)

Reasonable Execution time in parallel (#6):
    Java: soft limit around 2000000 (~30 seconds)
    JavaScript: soft limit around 2500000 (~30 seconds)
