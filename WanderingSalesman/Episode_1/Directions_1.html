        For this, simply produce a program that will solve the problem -- do NOT worry about performance. Use any
        language you like to write code that can read the "small-map.json" file or other files in a similar format
        from the inputdata folder, then find the paths from some starting point (like "A") of some length. Compare
        your results with those in "expected-count.json" for accuracy.
